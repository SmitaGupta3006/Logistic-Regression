# Logistic Regression

This project consists of classification on the basis of following and their mutual comparision:
Binary Classification Using Logistic Regression
Binary Classification Using L1-penalized logistic regression
Multi-class Classification (Gaussian and Multi- nomial priors, Na ̈ıve Bayes’ classifier)

Classification of time series
Classified the activities of humans based on time series obtained by a Wireless Sensor Network (AReM dataset)

About the dataset: The dataset contains 7 folders that represent seven types of activities. In each folder, there are multiple files each of which represents an instant of a human performing an activity. Each filr contains 6 time series collated from activities of the same person, which are called avg rss12, var rss12, avg rss13, var rss13, vg rss23, and ar rss23. There are 88 instances in the dataset, each of which con- tains 6 time series and each time series has 480 consecutive values.

Tools Used: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Sk-learn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scipy, Glob, Bootstrapped
